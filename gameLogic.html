                <h2>Game Logic:</h2>
                <li>
                    A function that initializes the game object( which includes grids, ships etc). Must be called before game
                    can be tested in console.
	                  <h4>initializeGame();</h4>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Takes a random point and pass into a function that places a ship.
                    Enter in what type of ship (carrier,battleship etc)
                    then the row and column on the grid (the random point),
                    then horizontal or vertical and lastly which grid you are
                    placing it on (playerGrid or computerGrid)
                    <h4>placeShip(ship, row, col, alignment, playerGrid);</h4>
                </li>
                <li>
                    A function that checks to make sure that the ship placement function is going
                    to be placed in a valid location. It gets called within the placeShip function
                    to check the validity before the ship is ever placed
                    <h4>GridCheck(row, col, size, alignment,playerGrid);</h4>
                </li>
                <li>
                    A way to randomly generate points to be used on the grid
                    <h4>generatePoint(); (returns a point)</h4>
                </li>
                <li>
                    A hard coded ship placement used for testing. Comes with all ships being created
                    in a set location. All you have to do is pass in which grid you are wanting to
                    place on and whose ships you are placing: for example:
	                 <h4>testPlacement(playerGrid, playerShips)</h4>
		                     Or
	                <h4>testPlacement(computerGrid, computerShips)</h4>
                </li>
                <li>
                    A function that is used to launch missiles on the enemies grid. This function checks
                    to see if the location you are passing in has already been shot at (hit or miss) if
                    it has it notifies the user that it has already marked this point. If it hasnt then it
                    checks the grid and marks it either hit or miss which are represented by O for miss and
                     X for hit. If it hits it calls another function that marks the enemies Ship object
                     as hit (markShipHit)
                     <h4>launchMissile(row,col,grid, enemy)</h4>

                     Inner function of launch Missile:
                     <h4>markShipHit(turnShips,coordinates)</h4>
                     This function loops over either the playerShips object or the computerShips object
                     (depending on what you pass in the turnShips parameter) and checks each ships set
                     location to see if they contain in the location array the same coordinates as what
                      you passed in. When it finds it it incriments the hits attribute on that ship. It
                       also checks to see if it sunk the ship that was hit. If so it increments the counter
                        on the corresponding playerShips or computerShips shipsSunk. It also checks each
                        time is sinks one to see if the game is over by calling the
                        <h4>isGameOver()</h4> if it is it alerts the user.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I am currently working on the computer guessing logic.
                    Thus far I have made a function that does unintelligent random guessing. It takes a
                    random point and calls the launch missile object on the playerGrid.
               <h4>computerRandomGuess()</h4>
                </li>
                <li>
                    I am working on making the function
                     <h4>targetComputerGuess()</h4>
                     which will hopefully make it so that once the computer makes a hit on the following
                     turn it will call this function which will pick an adjacent point to guess.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I still need to add functions that will control the turns for player and compute
                    The computerTurn() function will call either the randomGuess or targetedGuess based
                    on whether or not it had a hit the previous turn.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I need to add something that will manage game states.<br />
                </li>
                <li>
                    I need to work on the interface aspect quite a lot.<br />
                </li>
            </ol>
