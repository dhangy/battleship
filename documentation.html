    <h1>    My documenation for this project!:</h1>
    <p>
        I had so much fun making this battleship game! I had no idea how fun and difficult and rewarding it would be! Thanks for the opportunity to make something really cool!
        I dont know if I would have thought to use this as a learning tool if not for this class! So thanks again

        The game grid is always generated anew and dynamically using the createBoard Function.
        As you can see it is nicely styled using css. When you load the grid it has a checkerboard pattern of blues. Each cell color
        is updated according to what state it represents white indicated a miss gray indicates a ship and red indicates a hit on a ship
    </p>
    <p>
        This game gets user input through the grid primarily but it also uses buttons to get the info the place the ships.
        It previously had more types of selection but i found them to be unnecessary and less visually pleasing.

    </p>
    <p>
        There is dynamic modification of the HTML elements using the inner HTML each time a grid cell gets updated info on the model
        it gets updaetd on the view dynamically
    </p>
    <p>
        it incorporates an audio tag on the game description page to satisfy the first HTML 5 requirement(as well as after hits on the grid page) and it uses local storage to store the wins record
        to satifsy the extra credit requirement

    </p>
    <p>
        The game logic is obviously powering the game! Give the game a try to test that out!
