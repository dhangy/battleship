I have made a file called presetConfig.json that contains all of the json i am using.
I then use and manipulate the data from that json file in presetConfig.js
I take the ship configuration info from the json file and use it to update the model and place the ships in the grid
I also display a little message that is taken from the json that tells the user that their ship configuration was
placed automatically for them in a div above the game grid
